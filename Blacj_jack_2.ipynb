    "#BLACK JACK\n",
    "# Blackjack Game Rules\n",
    "# Objective:\n",
    "# The goal of Blackjack is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding it. The player plays against the dealer (computer), and the hand closest to 21 wins.\n",
    "# Card Values:\n",
    "# Ace (A): Can be worth 1 or 11, depending on what is more favorable for the player.\n",
    "# 2 to 10: Face value (i.e., 2 is worth 2 points, 3 is worth 3 points, etc.).\n",
    "# Face Cards (King, Queen, Jack): Each worth 10 points.\n",
    "# Gameplay:\n",
    "# Betting Phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The player starts by placing a bet using virtual chips.\n",
    "# Dealing Cards:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Both the player and the dealer receive two cards. The player's cards are visible, but one of the dealer's cards is face down (hidden).\n",
    "# Player's Turn:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The player is asked to choose between:\n",
    "# Hit: Draw an additional card.\n",
    "# Stand: Keep current cards and end the turn.\n",
    "# Double Down: Double the bet, draw one more card, and then stand automatically.\n",
    "# Fold: Stop the round and forfeit the bet.\n",
    "# The player continues to take actions until they either decide to stand, go over 21 (bust), or reach 21 (Blackjack).\n",
    "# Dealer's Turn:\n",
    "\n",
    "# After the player stands, the dealer reveals their hidden card.\n",
    "# The dealer must hit (draw cards) until they reach a minimum of 17 points.\n",
    "# If the dealer exceeds 21, the player wins.\n",
    "# Winning Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# If the player's hand value is greater than the dealer's hand without going over 21, the player wins.\n",
    "# If both hands are equal, it's a tie (push).\n",
    "# If the player goes over 21, they lose, even if the dealer also busts.\n",
    "# If the dealer goes over 21, the player wins.\n",
    "# Blackjack:\n",
    "\n",
    "# If the player gets an Ace and a 10-point card (10, Jack, Queen, King) as their initial two cards, they have a \"Blackjack\" and win immediately unless the dealer also has a Blackjack, in which case itâ€™s a tie.\n",
    "# End of Game:\n",
    "# The game continues as long as the player has chips to bet. If the player runs out of chips, the game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
